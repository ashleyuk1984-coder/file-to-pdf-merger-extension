# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the following icon files for the browser extension:

- `icon-16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon)
- `icon-32.png` - 32x32 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon-48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon-128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store listing)

## Icon Design Guidelines:
- Use the purple/pink gradient theme to match the webapp
- Include the document/PDF symbol (ðŸ“„) as the main element
- Ensure icons are clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Use transparent backgrounds
- Follow Material Design or Fluent Design principles

## Temporary Solution:
For testing, you can create simple colored squares as placeholders until proper icons are designed.

## Recommended Tools:
- Figma (web-based)
- Canva (web-based)
